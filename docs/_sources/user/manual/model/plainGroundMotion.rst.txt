.. _plainGroundMotion:

Plain Ground Motion
"""""""""""""""""""

This command is used to construct a plain GroundMotion object. Each GroundMotion object is associated with a number of TimeSeries objects, which define the acceleration, velocity and displacement records for that ground motion. The command is as follows:


.. function:: groundMotion($gmTag Plain <-accel $tsTag> <-vel $tsTag> <-disp $tsTag> <-int (IntegratorType intArgs)> <-fact $cFactor>)
where

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: "Argument", "Type", "Description"
   :widths: 10, 10, 40

   $gmTag, |integer|, unique tag among ground motions in load pattern
   $tsTag, |integer|, tag of TimeSeries object created using timeSeries command.
   integratorType, |string|, string inteagting type of integration (optional, default=Trapezoidal). See NOTES below.
   $cFactor, |float|, factor to be applied to motions (optional: default=1.0)

.. note::

   The displacements are the ones used in the ImposedMotions to set nodal response.

   Any combination of the acceleration, velocity and displacement time-series can be specified.

   If only the acceleration TimeSeries is provided, numerical integration will be used to determine the velocities and displacements.

   For earthquake excitations it is important that the user provide the displacement time history, as the one generated using the trapezoidal method will not provide good results.
