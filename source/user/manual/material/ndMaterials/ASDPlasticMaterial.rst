ASDPlasticMaterial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| This command is used to construct an ASDPlasticMaterial material object. ASDPlasticMaterial implements a large family of constitutive models based on the classical theory of elastoplasticity. Users build new constitutive models by selecting the yield function, plastic-flow direction, elasticity law, and hardening models for the internal variables from several possible options for each component. Currently, there are 60 unique possible choices, that will only grow as more options become available for each component. 

To create a new model, specify the Yield Function (YF) type, Plastic Flow (PF) type, and Elasticity (EL) type. If you specify these and nothing else, you'll get a print out of the internal variables and model parameters that define the model. All internal variables and model parameters are set to zero unless specified by the user, which might or not make sense depending on context. 

After setting the YF, PF and EL, you need to give initial values to internal variables within the |Begin_Internal_Variables| ... |End_Internal_Variables| block. Then, the |Begin_Model_Parameters| ... |End_Model_Parameters| block is used to provide model parameter values (these can be changed during the analysis with the setParameter command as expected). Finally, model integration options are set within the |Begin_Integration_Options| ... |End_Integration_Options| code block. Specification blocks can occur in any order. The complete command looks as follows:

The default integration method is **Runge_Kutta_45_Error_Control** that uses the classical RK45 ODE integration algorithm employing a 4-th order prediction of the stress increment together with a 5-order prediction to estimate the integration error. In this scheme the strain increment provided by the element to the Gauss point is sub-divided into sub-increments, a process which is automated such that the provided **$stress_relative_tol** is met. This method is provided as a robust standard method which is applicable across all possible combinations of components, although there are possibly better approaches for specific cases which might become available in the future. 

The different parameters are activated depending on the integration algorithm selected. The *Forward_Euler* algorithm only uses the **$return_to_yield_surface** parameter, while **Runge_Kutta_45_Error_Control** uses the rest. 

The **$f_relative_tol** parameter comes into play when the yield surface is being crossed, that is, when the previous (committed) stress is within the yield surface and the elastic prediction of the stress increment brings the stress state beyond the yield surface. In that case, an elastic increment occurs until the yield surface is touched which requires iterations with the Brent root finding algorithm. This is used by both currently available integration methods.
